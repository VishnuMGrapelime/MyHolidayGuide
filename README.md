## Getting Started

### 1. Clone using github url

### 2. Install dependencies

It is encouraged to use **pnpm** so the husky hooks can work properly.

```bash
pnpm install
```

or

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the development server

You can start the server using this command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

or

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Change defaults

There are some things you need to change including title, urls, favicons, etc.

Don't forget to change the package name in package.json
